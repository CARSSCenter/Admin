CARSS: an Open-Source Implantable Neuromodulation System

Who we are:
CARSS is part of the National Institute of Health (NIH)'s Human Open Research Neural Engineering Technologies (HORNET) initiative for open-architecture, open-source implantable neuromodulation systems. We are a collaborative team from the University of Southern California (USC, Los Angeles, CA), Medipace Inc. (Pasadena, CA), and Med-Ally LLC (Goose Creek, SC). The team fully supports the open-architecture, open-source goals of CARSS and the two industry members provide a path for sustainability of access to developed technology after the conclusion of the CARSS program.

Our goals:
The intent of CARSS is to enable a community-supported neurotechnology platform through our community engagement, education, and dissemination activities. Our approach considers users with diverse perspectives at different career stages, types of institutions, and backgrounds. The CARSS program is developed with the intent to lower barriers to entry for new investigators by removing technical and financial hurdles to getting access to implantable neuromodulation technologies designed with bioelectronic medicine indications in mind.
